* **Identifier**	- Unique alpha-numeric identifier used to identify the data (such as DOI or Handle)
* **Date** - Any key dates associated with the data, including project start and end dates
* **Title** - Name of the project or dataset
* **Version** - Information on the relevant version(s) of the dataset
* **Creator(s)** - Names, contact details and identifiers (such as ORCID) for all organisations and/or persons who collected and created the data
* **Source** - Citations for any data obtained or derived from other sources, including the creator, the year, the title of the dataset, identifier and access information
* **Location** - Relevant geographic information, including cities, regions, states, countries or coordinates
* **Keywords** - Keywords or phrases describing the data, this could also include relevant Field of Research codes
* **Methodology** - Information on how the data was created, including specific software or equipment (with model or version numbers), formulae, algorithms or methodologies
* **Processing** - Information on how the data has been transformed, altered or processed
* **Technical** - details	All relevant technical information including a list of all the files that make up the dataset with extensions and relevant file formats and structures, an explanation of any codes or abbreviations used in the file names, a list of all variables in the data files, as well as the names and version numbers of all software packages required to use, view, or analyse the data
* **Rights** - Any known intellectual property rights, statutory rights, licenses, or restrictions on use of the data

## <span style="color:#063970"> **II. Minimum requirements for the Murdoch University Research Portal** </span>

The minimum requirements for a dataset:
* **Data file** - Data file(s) should follow open standard formats.
* **Title** - Title should be short but descriptive and contain unique and meaningful information
* **Author(s)/Creator(s)** - At least one author name and affiliation
* **Publication date** - The date that the dataset is published

* **License** - A data license is a legal arrangement between the creator of the data and the end-user specifying what users can do with the data
* **For GRDC-funded project** - GRDC project code and name

## <span style="color:#063970"> **III. Additional information is highly encourage** </span>

Additional information is highly encourage, since it will support the findability and reusability of the dataset:
* **Time coverage** - When the data was collected
* **Spatial coverage** - Where the data was collected
* **Keywords** - [AGROVOC Multilingual Thesaurus](https://agrovoc.fao.org/browse/agrovoc/en/)
* [**Field of Research (FoR)**](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/classifications/australian-and-new-zealand-standard-research-classification-anzsrc/latest-release#data-downloads) codes
* **Related publications**

Other information
* **DOI and handle** - DOI and Unique Identifier of the metadata record will be generated by the Research Portal

## <span style="color:#063970"> **III. Activity** </span>
Deposit the data and metadata record to [Murdoch University Research Portal](https://researchportal.murdoch.edu.au/)
