#  <span style="color:#023047"> Data preparation steps </span>
This part will guide you through the data preparation steps

# <span style="color:#023047"> The FAIR components: </span>

## <span style="color:#063970"> **F - Findable** </span>
The main purpose of F is to prevent data loss, acknowledgment for the creators, increase the visibility of research and enable reusability.  
**How to:**
* Deposit your data to a data repository
* Advertise your data (conferences, presentations, etc.)
* Describe your data with rich metadata and standard vocabularies

## <span style="color:#063970"> **A - Accessible** </span>
The main purpose of A is to prevent data loss, regulate access via appropriate permission allocations, increase the visibility of research and enable reusability.  
**How to:**
* Describe conditions for data access.

<span style="color:red"> :bookmark_tabs: **FAIR is not equal to OPEN** </span>  
:bookmark_tabs: **Accessible means 'Accessible under well defined conditions'**

**These conditions can be used in the Research Portal**    
*--Note: Metadata should always be findable and accessable--*   

**Open**: Data are accessible with any Creative Commons Licence.  

**Restricted**(*default*): Data are only accessible by third parties with approval from the Data Custodian and the relevant GRDC Investment Manager.

**Embargoed**: Data are closed until the end of a specified embargo period to allow for publication of research or commercialisation activities.  
*--After embargo, the access right change to ‘Restricted’ unless otherwise indicated--*

**Closed**: Data are not available for use by third parties.  

## <span style="color:#063970"> **I - Interoperable** </span>
The main purpose of I is to enable the exchange of metadata and data. It also help increasing the visibility of research and enable reusability.  
How to:  
* Use vocabularies which follow the FAIR principles
* Use standard data format
* Add references to other data into your metadata (i.e. link to other dataset)

:bookmark_tabs: *Try to use open format (i.e. txt, csv,...) instead of proprietary format whenever possible*  
:bookmark_tabs: *Use standard vocabularies and definitions*  

## <span style="color:#063970"> **R - Reusable** </span>
The main purpose of R is to create a foundation for collaborations and further research, by acknowledging the creators of the metadata/data. It also help increasing the visibility of research.  
How to:  
* Deposit your data to a data repository with rich metadata
* Include a license in your metadata

:bookmark_tabs: *Try to include as much information as possible in your metadata record and data files*  
:bookmark_tabs: *Specify a suitable license for your data when deposit it to the repository*
