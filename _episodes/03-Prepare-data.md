### 1. Content

:question: Do the dataset easy to understand?  
:question: What improvements can be done to make the dataset more easier to understand?

### 2. Data format

:question: Which format did the datasets follow?  
:question: Will they be easy to processed or manipulated using computer software?

:bookmark_tabs: *An open data format allows anyone to build the tools required to work with that data.*  
:arrow_right: *No need to pay expensive licensing for propietary software.*  

### 3. Data standard

[FAIR sharing](https://fairsharing.org/) is a good place to look for data standard.  
:bookmark_tabs: *Preparing data following standard enable [R]eusability and [I]nteroperability of your data.*

### Multi-environmental phenotype data - Improved

The <a href="files/PER_COR_ESP_Phenotype_2017.2019"> Download Sample data 2</a>  
Please have a look at the improved dataset

:question: Do the dataset easy to understand?    
:question: What improvements can be done?  
:question: Which format did the datasets follow?    

:bookmark_tabs: In the case of large dataset, try separating the data into different files (i.e. Experiment information, Variety information)  
:bookmark_tabs: This will allow users to get the additional information without opening the main data
