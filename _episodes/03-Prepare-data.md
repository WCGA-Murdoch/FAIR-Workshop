### 1. Content

:question: Do the dataset easy to understand?  
:question: What improvements can be done to make the dataset more easier to understand?

### 2. Data format

:question: Which format did the datasets follow?  
:question: Will they be easy to processed or manipulated using computer software?

:bookmark_tabs: *An open data format allows anyone to build the tools required to work with that data.*  
:arrow_right: *No need to pay expensive licensing for propietary software.*  

### 3. Data standard

[FAIR sharing](https://fairsharing.org/) is a good place to look for data standard.  
:bookmark_tabs: *Preparing data following standard enable [R]eusability and [I]nteroperability of your data.*
